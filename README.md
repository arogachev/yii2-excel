# Yii 2 Excel

** This is fork of https://github.com/arogachev/yii2-excel **
Fixed compatibility issues with PHP 7.2 

ActiveRecord import and export based on PHPExcel for Yii 2 framework.

This library is mainly designed to import data, export is in the raw condition (even it's working in basic form),
under development and not documented yet.

The important notes:

- It uses ActiveRecord models and PHPExcel library, so operating big data requires pretty good hardware, especially RAM.
In case of memory shortage I can advise splitting data into smaller chunks.
- This is not just a wrapper on some PHPExcel methods, it's a tool helping import data from Excel in human readable
form with minimal configuration.
- This is designed for periodical import.
- The library is more effective when working with multiple related models and complex data structures.
